# Solutionshub - Project 3 at Ironhack bootcamp

## Introduction 

A website where Ironhack students can browse, upvote and serach through solutions to exercises given during the bootcamp. 
At Ironhack students submit their exricises by doing a pull request of the starter code of that exercise. All solutions is there for on GitHub, but it is hard to find the best one. This website solves that problem. 

To play with the site go to: https://solutionshub.herokuapp.com/

## Setup

If youâ€™d like to view my project in your browser:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/aioimo/ironhackproject2.git
$ cd 2-backend-project
$ npm i
$ touch .env

```

Now you have to add the following in the .env file:

```
PORT=3005
ENV=development
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost/goals-project
```
At this point everything except the image upload works. It is not necessary for playing with the app but if you want to upload a profile picture you can create a cloudinary account and add your credentials like this in the .env file: 

```
CLOUDINARY_NAME=your-name
CLOUDINARY_SECRET=your-secret
CLOUDINARY_KEY=your-key

```

Now run:

``` $ npm run dev ```
